# Front-end Live-coding Session

## Introduction

You will need to grab on the requirements and complete the project while ensuring the application to have great engineering and well-design by using API endpoints given at:

### API:

-   `http`: http://c8036bd8-ea01-4f47-9ff1-dbf8001a0500.mock.pstmn.io
-   `https`: https://c8036bd8-ea01-4f47-9ff1-dbf8001a0500.mock.pstmn.io
-   `https`: https://react-code-challenge-mock-api.netlify.app

## Scenario

Once upon a time... nope!
So here, you have been temporarily hired by Opn and assigned to work on the little e-commerce project which the previously assigned front-end developer and designer got the urgent matters to solve, so they will not be able to finish the project on time.

Desire to win the war? Well, to make it a little more fun, please remember that

**You cannot**:

-   Change existing behaviors.
-   Change the API server.
-   Change from JavaScript/TypeScript to other languages.
